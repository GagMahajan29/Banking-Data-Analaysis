## Banking-Data-Analaysis

**Problem Statement** â€“
Develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers.

**Solution** - 
With the dashboard I created using PowerBI, banks can make data-driven decisions while lending loans to customers on the basis of whether they can potentially repay their loan or not. This would help minimize losses to the bank due to non-repayment of loans. 

**Techstack used** -
1. Python
2. Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
3. Microsoft PowerBI.
